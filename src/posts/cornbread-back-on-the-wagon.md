I heard some of you boys need a winner. Now I know I’ve been laying low, but Skaggs called me this morning and wanted me to share a hot skillet of cornbread.

It’s gonna be a not so “Hotty Toddy” Saturday morning for the rebels as they face off against a 3 loss South Carolina team straight of a close win against UT.

Get South Carolina now for a Pk

See you boys at the window.
