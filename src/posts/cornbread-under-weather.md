It’s a crispy cold cruiser out here under the Friday night lights as the high flying Dacula Falcons face off against the Northgate Vikings. But it’s not as frosty as it will be in Yspilanti, Michigan Saturday morning.  

The Eastern Michigan Eagles host the Akron zips at the ever so bitter Rynearson Stadium. This mid-American conference matchup should be about as fun as watching paint dry.  

If your looking for something to warm you up, try a sweet savory piece of cornbread served by your favorite cousin izzy.  

Don’t be shy about it boys, take the under at 42.5  

See you at the window.
