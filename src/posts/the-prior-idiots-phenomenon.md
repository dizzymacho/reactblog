Sometimes a new person joins your team and immediately decides the way things are done is stupid and/or inefficient. They invent their own process without taking the time to understand why existing processes are in place.

Theyâ€™ve dubbed it... "The Prior Idiots Phenomenon"

This might be good to include in employee onboarding everywhere.
