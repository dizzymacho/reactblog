I was trolling through Twitter the other day and came across a fantastic post by Mr. John McAfee. If you don't know who he is, this island hopping, crypto pumping security expert is addicted to being the man.  

Don't just take my word for it, watch [his documentary on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80148180).  

John casually tweets about a woman at a bar in Hatteras that wants to bang him and rebuttals someone who says he looks like a corroded testicle.

You just keep being awesome "John Fucking McAfee".
