Things don't look good for the NFL. I said years ago it would slowly fade away over the next 20 years and it seems to be doing just that. One of the biggest pain points I see is that the system forces kids to join the NCAA for two years before moving on to the NFL.

Now there are many reasons for this rule being in place, but in this modern era, these kids are forced to gamble their livelihood for two years and forfeit their ability to generate personal revenue during their peak years of profitability. Only 1% even makes it to the next level, but what happens to the other 99%?

Well, insert Vince McMahon and the XFL.

We've been here before with the XFL, but lately the NFL has been ripe for disruption. Think of the NFL/NCAA as a big record label and the XFL as SoundCloud.  

Regardless if you kneel or stand, the system may have some trouble on their hands in the near future.

God Speed Vince!
